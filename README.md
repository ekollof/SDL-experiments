# SDL-experiments
Just me messing with SDL.

I'm creating a small and simple top-down shooter with a tile based engine in SDL to figure out how SDL works. Just for fun. Yes, code quality will be awful. I'm not going for beauty here.

The project uses visual studio 2013 for now, I will make Makefiles when I port this over to real operating systems.
